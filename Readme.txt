Thank you for downloading the iConfRTC SDK

About this demo
===============

This is a demo that shows you how to quickly build webrtc enabled video conferencing application using the iCOnfRTC SDK.

This demo uses the iConfRTC SDK for Windows Forms ( a nuget package avilable here https://www.nuget.org/packages/iConfRTC.Winform.X86/)


The concept is simple :

Users join a 'Meeting' 

Users that are in the same meeting can see hear each other.

Steps :

Step 1 Run the demo from one PC, enter a meeting ID and your Name in the appropriate text fields.

Step 2 Click on Join Meeting

Step 3 Run the demo from another PC. In the Meeting ID field enter the same meeting ID that you picked in step 1

Step 4 Click on Join Meeting

The user on the first PC will see/hear the user from teh second PC and vice versa
